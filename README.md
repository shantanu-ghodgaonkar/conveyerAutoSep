Address Detection: The barcode scanner reads package addresses as they pass through the scanning point.
Arduino Uno Control: The Arduino processes scanned information, interpreting the package's destination.
Conveyor Mechanism: A DC motor, controlled by Arduino, actuates the conveyor. Upon address detection, the Arduino commands servo motors to guide the package towards the designated bin.
Segregation Mechanism: A dual-axis turntable with servo motors rotates along two axes, allowing packages to be directed to specific bins.
Components:

Servo Motors: Two control rotation on each axis.
Turntable Platform: Holds the object being rotated.
Turntable Mount: Holds the servo motors, mounted on the conveyor body.
Base Structure: Supports the turntable platform for stability.
Parallax PING))) Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures distances for object detection.
Relay: An electrically operated switch.
LCD Display Module: Provides real-time information.
Technological Choice:

2D barcode scanning is chosen for its proven simplicity and efficiency, enhancing address detection accuracy.

Project Objectives:

Minimize manual effort.
Decrease sorting errors.
Significantly improve speed and accuracy.
Future Enhancements:

Machine Learning Integration: Optimize sorting algorithms based on data, package types, and destinations.
